## 💡 Object-Oriented Programming (Java)
*November 2024 – December 2024*

Developed a Java application demonstrating **classes**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **encapsulation**. Implemented user input handling, data processing, and error management using standard libraries. Focused on writing **clean**, **modular**, and **reusable** code to ensure scalability and maintainability.

**Key Features:**
- Designed an **object-oriented architecture** using Java classes and interfaces.  
- Implemented **polymorphism and inheritance** to manage multiple object types efficiently.  
- Added robust **input validation** and **exception handling**.  
- Applied **modular programming principles** to enhance code readability and reusability.  
- Demonstrated **data encapsulation** and abstraction to maintain clean class structures.  

**Tech Stack:** Java, IntelliJ IDEA, Java Standard Libraries (I/O, Collections, Exception Handling)
